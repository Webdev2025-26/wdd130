    <p>Hello everyone, for a carreer path i'll be trying to get a cybersecurity job i've always loved
        coding and the power that goes with being able to create your own ideas out of scratch
    I do love doing security for my own websites i've always thought it would be cool to be able to make a job
out of hunting down scammers and all that, though in all honesty I'm more into the creating part of coding but cybersecurity does have many more benefits than creating.
 </p>

 <p>My favorite things to do is Parkour, I can do most flips with ease but the back flip was never for me and I could never get past the idea of going backwards,
    front flips, side flips, 180's are more of my thing, I don't really do it for exersice but for more the idea of showing off which probably isn't the most worthy thing I could be doing,
    I also do xc and track to stay in shape and too stay healthy.


 </p>

 <p>I chose BYUI becuase they have a lot of classes that fit my interests I also love the idea of having a faith centered learning, 
    it'll also be nice to be able to involve God in my everyday learning as well. me and my family were born in the church but we try to attend every sunday and go to the ward activities and meals, I do plan on getting married sometime in the future but as of right now I'm preparing to head out on a mission
 </p>

 <p>Some of my Favorite scriptures are some of the "psalms" of nephi in 2 nephi 4:19 </p>
